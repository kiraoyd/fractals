//Week 5: Day 1
//Crates.io <-- you will find helpful things here, avoid crates without rustdoc or bad rustdoc
//Closures - capture variables from the environment, the closure can refer to stuff that isn't in the closure
//Most languages that have closures (c and c++ DO NOT)
//First-class functions
//We want variables to stay visible until the closure is done with with
//Rust uses lifetimes to ensure this happens






fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
